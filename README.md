## ðŸ”° About
Personal project showing an icosahedron an icosahedron that reacts by animating and making sounds to changes made on Wikipedia.

The App connects to the endpoint https://stream.wikimedia.org/v2/stream/recentchange via server-sent connection and reacts to the various messages sent by Wikipedia.

Depending on the size of the change, a sampled sound is chosen to play. The icosahedron finally reacts to the sounds using the AudioAnalyser interface of Three.js.
